Requirements:

        * Web server software with support for PHP 5.4 or above
        * PHP PDO drivers for PostgreSQL or MySQL/MariaDB or SQLite
        * Database server (except if you are using SQLite database)


Installation step-by-step:

1. Extract this archive into web server root directory or clone
   git repository with command:

        git clone https://github.com/webiness/webiness_inventory


2. Make runtime directory writable by web server.

   On unix/linux servers enter command:

        chmod 777 webiness_inventory/runtime

   If you are using Linux server distributions, that uses SELinux secirity
   mechanism, like RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, you will also need to enter following
   commands as root user:

        chcon -R -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t user
        chcon -R -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t webiness_inventory/runtime

3. If you want to use this applicatio with 'real' database servers like
   PostgreSQL or MySQl, you will also need to create database user and
   database itself. If you intend to use SQLite database you can skip this
   step.

   For PostgreSQL enter following as postgres user:

        createuser -l -R -S -P <new_dbuser_name>
        (enter <password> for new user on prompt)
        createdb -O <new_dbuser_name> -T template0 -E utf8 <new_db_name>

   For MySQl or MariaDB database servers:

        mysql -u root -p mysql
        (enter your mysql root password on prompt)
        create database <new_db_name> default character set = utf8;
        grant all on <new_db_name>.* to '<new_dbuser_name>'@'localhost'
                IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';


    Also, you may use gui administration tools, if you have one, to do
    same job as described above.

4. Configure application to use your database settings by opening file
   webiness_inventory/protected/config/config.php in your favorite text
   editor and changing these lines:

        WsConfig::set('db_driver', 'mysql'); // or pgsql, or sqlite
        WsConfig::set('db_host', '<your_db_hostname>'); // ignored for SQLite
        WsConfig::set('db_name', '<naw_db_name'); // ignored for SQLite
        WsConfig::set('db_user', '<new_dbuser_name>'); // ignored for SQLite
        WsConfig::set('db_password', '<password>'); // ignored for SQLite

    Enter settings that will match your database settings which are
    defined in step 3.
    Also, you can put these lines at end of file and live original lines
    untuchet. It will have the same effect.

    NOTE: Don't create database tables by executing schema_*.sql scripts
    from application directory. Application will do this by it self, on
    first load.

5. Create admin user by changing or adding auth_admin config line
   in the same file (webiness_inventory/protected/config/config.php):

        WsConfig::set('auth_admin', '<admin_mail@whatewer.com>');

   Default password will be set to admin, you can change that after
   first login. Admin user can add new users and he controls whole
   user managment system.

6. Point your web browser to address of installed app, and login.
   First steps in application could be:

        6.1. Change admin user password (click on email addres in top right corner)
        6.2. Edit your company details (in settings menu)
        6.3. Add bussiness partners
             (suppliers and customers are treated same, as partners)
        6.4. Add product categories
             (each category can have different tax rates, you will need at least one)
        6.5. Add products
        6.6. Create documents
